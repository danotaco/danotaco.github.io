					<p>A lot of people hear "eCommerce" and probably think of shopping for simple, tangible goods with nice looking products photos. They think of a producer of things you can hold in your hand - a business that lends itself perfectly to an out-of-the-box Shopify-esque experience.</p>
					<p>My eCommerce work has needed me to solve design problems for complex business circumstances: intangible goods (like events and subscriptions to services), zero product photos, sign-in wall member pricing, and integration with Learning & Development platforms.</p>
					<p>Not as easy as selling shoes. But there's still a good experience to be had for customers.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p class="animate-box"><a href="https://brxw1b.axshare.com/ecommerce_checkout.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/1-screenflows.gif" class="img-responsive" alt="screenflow diagram animation"></a></p>
					<!--<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="images/ecommerce/2-screenflows-zoomed-out.png"><img src="images/ecommerce/2-screenflows-zoomed-out.png" class="img-responsive" alt="static screenflow diagram"></a></p>-->
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://brxw1b.axshare.com/ecommerce_checkout.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/3-screenflows-zoomed-in.png" class="img-responsive" alt="static screenflow diagram"></a></p>
					<p>Knowing that ultimately my design would have many dependencies on established business processes and platforms, I faciliated hours of design planning sessions with business stakeholders, subject matter experts and developers to plan frontend screenflows.</p>
					<p>I found that screenflows were a great tool inventorying potential design patterns and navigation paths that could still support the varied workflow of some very differentiated product types. For example, the Add to Cart experience for an event (e.g. a speaking engagement) necessitates different inputs and outputs than buying a suite of continuing education classes - especially when the customer needs to track their academic progress against an existing "learning profile" with historical records and prerequisites.</p>
					<p>I knew by beginning the design phase with baselining the user experience as lower-fidelity screenflows (rather than jumping into hifi wireframes from the outset) would be crucial to gaining buy-in without bogging down the schedule with pixel-perfect details upfront. For business stakeholders, they gained a thorough understanding of all customer touchpoints and how their product suites would be differentiated in an easy to consume format. For developers, they gained enough scoping insight to plan for platform integration points, give schedule and cost estimates, and begin planning platform updates in advance.</p>
					<p>I used Axure RP to create my screenflow diagrams to better create deliverables for consumption in digital/on-screen format, complete with tabbed product categories and floating description panels. I hand-designed all these features myself without working from a template.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/event_product_detail.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/4a-checkout.gif" class="img-responsive" alt="checkout animation"></a></p>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/event_product_detail.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/4b-product-page.png" class="img-responsive" alt="product detail page"></a></p>
					<p>During wireframing, I made sure product detail pages included related products to maximize upsell (related suites) and crosssell (add-ons) opportunities.
					<br><br><br>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/event_product_detail.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/5-non-signed-in.png" class="img-responsive" alt="add to cart"></a></p>
					<p>While designing the pricing cluster, I referenced well-established usability studies to inform element-level details. I was working with the added complexity of a members-only pricing model, so I had to be especially thoughtful of hierarchy. In the above non-signed-in experience, I deliberately illustrated the lower price first (to entice), and illustrated the discount opportunity in red (studies have shown red text resonates more for emphasizing customer savings in the context of product detail pages and shopping carts). I was also conscious of showing visitors both the discount percentage and nominal cash savings.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/event_product_detail.html#OnLoadVariable=TransitionLightbox&CSUM=1"><img src="images/ecommerce/6-checking-for-discounts.png" class="img-responsive" alt="checking for discounts"></a></p>
					Even knowing the system could instantaneously locate and apply member discounts for a signed-in user, I deliberately designed a timed wait screen - lasting just a moment - to demonstrate to shoppers that the business was making a concerted effort to save them as much money as possible.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="images/ecommerce/7-member-signed-in.png"><img src="images/ecommerce/7-member-signed-in.png" class="img-responsive" alt="checking for discounts"></a></p>
					<p>For signed-in users with member discounts, I designed a differentiated pricing cluster from non-signed-in users - referencing established usability studies again to maximize conversion rates: The non-member price in a larger font (to convey "bigger" price"), a strikethrough (to emphasize "not a price you have to worry about, saver!"), and that red text again with percentage and nominal value (to reinforce savings advantage).
					<br><br><br>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/cart.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/8-shopping-cart.png" class="img-responsive" alt="product detail page"></a></p>
					<p>More conversion tactics in my shopping cart design. Upon adding an item to the cart, I offer the user both the ability to continue shopping (crosssell), but also to checkout immediately (sealing the deal on the conversion).</p>
					<p>I included a deliberate "How we protect your information" link to give the shopper confidence that their information is secured during this transaction. Rather than make the user find the privacy policy, studies have shown better conversion rates when the seller is upfront and transparent about data collection.</p>
					<p>I rounded out the shopping cart page with a crosssell "You might also like" section, driven by category tagging and personalization.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/match_found.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/9-multiple-profiles.png" class="img-responsive" alt="add to cart"></a></p>
					<p>Here's where the complexities of a learning & development system get even more fun for UX. In the design above, the user has signed-in during Add to Cart, but the system recognizes multiple matching "learning profiles" from the integrated Learning Management System (LMS). Knowing the customer would want to apply a completed training course to their established transcipt, the system prompts the user to select a learning profile to ensure their academic progress is tracked for posterity.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/included_in_bank_license.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/10-included.png" class="img-responsive" alt="checking for discounts"></a></p>
					<p>Depending on the customer's license agreement, the terms of their subscription may include some products at no extra cost. I designed this screen to make sure the user feels good about their subscription payment and that they're getting its worth.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/more_options.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/11-more-options.png" class="img-responsive" alt="checking for discounts"></a></p>
					<p align="center" class="animate-box"><a href="https://tcie41.axshare.com/creating_lms_profile.html"><img src="images/ecommerce/12-creating-profile.png" class="img-responsive" alt="checking for discounts"></a></p>
					<p>Realizing that some users may still want to track their academic progress with their employer separately from their personal persona, I designed an experience to guide users in creating a separate profile directly from the Add to Cart flow - without losing the conversion along the way.<p>
